This repository stores my solutions for problems from sites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com), etc.

Some of them can be not efficient by default. I didn't set the goal to make the most effective solution. So be careful if you decide to use them.

There are two reasons I hae made this repository:
- The first one is to improve my own algorithmic and problem-solving skills, because I self-taught software engineer.
- The second one is to avoid algorithmic interviews.

I think knowledge of algorithms and data structures is pretty useful, but at the same time a lot of companies overuse them on technical interviews.
Especially when it happens due interview for senior and lead positions. Anyway. Enjoy the code, improve yourself and don't stop learn new things.
